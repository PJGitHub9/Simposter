# Changelog

- **Logo Selection Tweaks**: Improved white-logo preference and selection heuristics for clearer marks.

## v1.4.3

## v1.4.2
- Added SQLite-backed cache for Plex movies (labels/tmdb/poster metadata) with new `/api/cache/*` endpoints and incremental updates from live calls.

- Batch edit tab updates and local asset tab improvements.
- Settings persistence now centralized in the SQL db (legacy JSON migrated automatically).
- Version badge bumped to v1.4.2.

## v1.4.1
- Added visible version badge (top nav and Settings) and centralized version constant.
- Fixed presets: text overlay state and fields now reset/apply correctly; reload pulls fresh values.
- Preview/batch rendering now merges preset options with live slider values so UI tweaks reflect in renders.
- Batch mode improvements: preview caching when cycling movies; status overlay while batch runs; saves honor `saveLocation` and optional batch subfolder.
- Save-to-disk fixes: paths mapped under `/config/output`, template filename respected, frontend shows saved path.
- Settings: new “save batch runs into subfolder” toggle; scan library overlay shows progress/items.
